# Processes

The SOC follows these key processes:

1. **Monitoring:** Continuous surveillance of network and system activity.
2. **Incident Detection:** Identifying potential threats and anomalies.
3. **Incident Response:** Investigating and mitigating detected incidents.
4. **Threat Intelligence:** Gathering and analyzing information about emerging threats.
5. **Reporting:** Documenting incidents and providing insights to stakeholders.

## SOC Workflow

The following diagram represents a basic incident management process in a SOC:

## SOC Automation Script

Below is an example Python script that simulates handling a SOC alert:

```python
import time

def handle_alert(alert):
    print(f"Processing alert: {alert}")
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Alert resolved.")

# Example alert
handle_alert("Suspicious login detected.")
